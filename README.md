# BirthdayCircuit
Arduino code for a circuit that displayed my birthday.

Attached are my code files and an image of my finished circuit for EECS, which displays my birthday. I used an Arduino Nano, Seven Segment Display (M72), 47 microfarad Capacitor, eight 330 ohm resistors, 74LS193, and 555 timer.
